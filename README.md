# Gilded Rose

## What is this?
This is a solution to the famous Gilded Rose kata in Ruby.

## How to use

* Clone this repo
* Load it into the irb
* Make some new items (it looks like those in the texttest_fixture.rb)
* Make a new instance of GildedRose with your lovely items
* Update the heck out of it


## Approach

My main purpose with this refactor was to ensure that making the Conjured class was as easy as possible. In the end, adding the conjured class took me < 10 minutes.

I also wanted to approach this as if it were a real-life problem, so I put some focus into making the code open enough to add new products easily in the future and also creating public methods that were readable and easy to understand on face value.

## Next steps

* Provide for some edge cases that I missed
* Try to extract some responsibility for the tickets class
